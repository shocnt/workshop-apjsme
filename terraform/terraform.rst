Terraform Leveraging
--------------------

Using Terraform to allow Calm to support Alicloud
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
--------

- Using **Terraform** to focus on IAC (Infrastructure as a Code)
- Using **Calm** to focus on application deployment, and Day 2 operations
- Download blueprints you want to try:

    - :download:`Alicloud ECS with TF <https://github.com/panlm/NTNX/raw/master/calm/blueprints/Terraform-Alicloud.json>`
    - :download:`AWS EC2 with TF <https://github.com/panlm/NTNX/raw/master/calm/blueprints/Terraform-AWS.json>`

- Upload blueprints to Calm
    - You will be prompted to input the **passphrase**, please use **nutanix/4u**.
    - Maybe you need setup the **template** and **network** for Terraform VM
    - Save it and ready to launch

Blueprint
---------

- **Service 1**: New VM

    - New a Service, **Cloud** is **Nutanix**

        .. figure:: images/terr1.png

    - You can assign 1 vcpu / 1 GB memory to this VM
    - Execute `terraform` command on this VM and create ECS instances on Alicloud. Get the public IP of the new instance.

- **Service 2**: Existed VM

    - New a Service, **Cloud** is **Existing Machine**
    - Get the IP addresses from previous services `@@{Terraform.ecs_pub_ip[calm_array_index]}@@`

        .. figure:: images/terr2.png

Launch It
---------

- If you need to create multi ECS instances on Alicloud, just assign variable **num** before you launch blueprint.
- If you launch successfully, you will see the public IP of Alicloud ECS.

How to access ECS VMs
---------------------

- Click **Open Termianl** to open the console of **Terraform VM**, using **terraform** credential to login

    .. figure:: images/terr4.png

    - Or use this :ref:`ssh_key_priv` to login **Terraform VM** with username **centos**

- You will find one folder named with **number**. In this screenshot, we have folder named **8931**. Remeber to execute **terraform** CLI in this folder

    .. figure:: images/terr5.png

- I have save key information for you. 

    .. figure:: images/terrinfo0.png

    - file **ecs_pub_ip** has all public ip addresses of ECS you have built

        .. figure:: images/terrinfo1.png

    - file **privatekey-tfkey-8931** has private key, you could use it to connect to your ECS instances

    - file **key_name** has the name of the key. you will need it when you run **terraform** CLI

        .. figure:: images/terrinfo2.png

    - Also you could get these info with

        .. code-block:: bash

            terraform output publicip
            terraform output privatekey

- Try to connect to ECS instance

    .. figure:: images/terrinfo3.png

- Enjoy your ECS instances.

Prerequisite
------------

- You should have a basic understanding of services provided by public clouds.

    - For AWS, you should know IAM, EC2, etc. 
    - For Alicloud, you should know RAM, ECS, etc.

- You should have public-cloud privider accounts (AWS or Alicloud) for this lab with **Programmatic access** enabled.
- You should be a fan of **CLI** (just kidding!)

3-steps to deploy AWS EC2 with Terraform
----------------------------------------

#. Install **terraform** on your Laptop. (This is Macbook example, for more OS, check the link `HERE <https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html>`_)

    - Download the binaries for your OS, for example: :download:`MacOS 64-bit <https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.10/terraform_0.12.10_darwin_amd64.zip>`
    - Unzip it
    - Move **terraform** to your **/usr/local/bin/**
    - try to run **terraform --version** to verify it is workable

#. Create AWS config

    - Create a new folder for test purposes
    - Copy and paste following code, it will help you to create a file named **aws.tf**

        .. code-block:: bash
        
            echo '
            # will create ssh key for each instance, keep key name different
            variable "key_name" {}
            variable "instance_num" {}

            # using your access_key and secret_key
            provider "aws" {
                region = "ap-northeast-2"
                access_key = "xxx"
                secret_key = "xxx"
            }

            # create ssh key pair
            resource "tls_private_key" "example" {
                algorithm = "RSA"
                rsa_bits  = 4096
            }

            # upload public key to aws, using defined name
            resource "aws_key_pair" "generated_key" {
                key_name   = "${var.key_name}"
                public_key = "${tls_private_key.example.public_key_openssh}"
            }

            # save private key to output for CLI
            output "privatekey" {
                value = "${tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem}"
            }            

            # find the image name with regex in your self image list, 
            #data "aws_ami" "image" {
            #    name_regex = "^centos.*"
            #    owners     = ["self"]
            #}

            # or you could get standard image from public
            data "aws_ami" "latest-ubuntu" {
                most_recent = true
                owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
                filter {
                    name   = "name"
                    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"]
                }
                filter {
                    name   = "virtualization-type"
                    values = ["hvm"]
                }
                filter {

                    values = ["ebs"]
                }
            }

            # create instance
            resource "aws_instance" "example" {
                # using count to create multi instances, unfortunately, this character do not support in alicloud
                count         = "${var.instance_num}"
                ami           = data.aws_ami.latest-ubuntu.image_id
                instance_type = "t2.micro"
    
                # using the key name we just create
                key_name      = "${aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name}"

                tags = {
                    name = "TerrVM"
                }

                # after instance created successfully, will try to create a connection to execute some commands

                }

                # remote-exec will execute commands in your AWS EC2 instance
                provisioner "remote-exec" {
                    inline = [
                        "echo ${self.public_ip} > pub_ip_addr",
                    ]
                }

                # local-exec will execute commands in this Terraform VM to save the public ip address to a temproary file
                provisioner "local-exec" {
                    command = "echo ${self.public_ip} > /tmp/pub_ip_addr"
                }
            }

            # print something in stdout
            output "publicip" {
                value = "${aws_instance.example[*].public_ip}"
            }
            ' |tee aws.tf

#. run **terraform**

    - Execute the following commands to launch AWS EC2 instances

        .. code-block:: bash

            terraform init
            terraform apply -var key_name="tfkey-111" -var instance_num=3

    - Execute the following commands to get some variable we define in output

        .. code-block:: bash

            terraform output publicip
            terraform output privatekey

    - Execute the following commands to terminate AWS EC2 instances

        .. code-block:: bash

            terraform init
            terraform destroy -var key_name="tfkey-111" -var instance_num=3


Key Takeaways
+++++++++++++

Configuration Management vs Provisioning
----------------------------------------

- **Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack** are all configuration management tools, which means they are designed to install and manage software on existing servers. 
- **CloudFormation and Terraform** are provisioning tools, which means they are designed to provision the servers themselves (as well as the rest of your infrastructure, like load balancers, databases, networking configuration, etc), leaving the job of configuring those servers to other tools.

Mutable Infrastructure vs Immutable Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------

- Configuration management tools such as **Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack** typically default to a mutable infrastructure paradigm. 
    
    - Best scenario is if you try to do some advanced or customized configuration in your deployment

- Provisioning tools such as **Terraform** typically default to a immutable infrastructure paradigm.

    - Best scenarios is if you just need basic OS and docker or kubernetes, no more customization
    - If you try to do some customization after provisioning with terraform, it will be not very elegant.

Procedural vs Declarative
-------------------------

- **Chef and Ansible** encourage a procedural style where you write code that specifies, step-by-step, how to to achieve some desired end state.
- **Terraform, CloudFormation, SaltStack, and Puppet** all encourage a more declarative style where you write code that specifies your desired end state, and the IAC tool itself is responsible for figuring out how to achieve that state.
