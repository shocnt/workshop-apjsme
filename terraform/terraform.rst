LAB: Terraform Leveraging
-------------------------

How Easy Terraform Is ÔºÅ
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Prerequisite
------------

- You should know basic concept of services provided by mainly public cloud. 

    - For AWS, you should know IAM, EC2, etc. 
    - For Alicloud, you should know RAM, ECS, etc.

- You should have an account of public cloud privider (AWS or Alicloud) for this lab with **Programmatic access** enabled.
- You should have at least one **image template** available and at lease one **key pair** existed
- You should be a fan of **CLI** (just kidding!)

3-step to deploy VM with Terraform
----------------------------------

#. install **terraform** on your Laptop. (this is Macbook example, for more OS, check link `HERE <https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html>`_)

    - download binary for your OS :download:`MacOS 64-bit <https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.10/terraform_0.12.10_darwin_amd64.zip>`
    - unzip it
    - move `terraform` to your `/usr/local/bin/`
    - try to run `terraform --version` to verify it is workable

#. create aws config

    - create a new folder for test
    - copy and paste following code, it will help you to create a file named **aws.tf**

        .. code-block:: language
        
            echo '
            # using your access_key and secret_key
            provider "aws" {
                region = "ap-northeast-2"
                access_key = "xxx"
                secret_key = "xxx"
            }

            # find the image name with regex in your self image list, 
            # or you could get image from ami market
            data "aws_ami" "image" {
                name_regex = "^centos.*"
                owners     = ["self"]
            }

            # create instance
            # using your key pair name, no username/password login permitted in AWS EC2
            # after instance created successfully, will try to create a connection to execute some commands
            # remote-exec will execute commands in your AWS EC2 instance
            # local-exec will execute commands in this Terraform VM to save the public ip address to a temproary file
            resource "aws_instance" "example" {
                ami           = data.aws_ami.image.image_id
                instance_type = "t2.micro"
                key_name      = "root-key"

                tags = {
                    name = "TerrVM"
                }

                connection {
                    host        = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
                    type        = "ssh"
                    user        = "centos"
                    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
                }

                provisioner "remote-exec" {
                    inline = [
                        "echo ${aws_instance.example.public_ip} > pub_ip_addr",
                    ]
                }

                provisioner "local-exec" {
                    command = "echo ${aws_instance.example.public_ip} > /tmp/pub_ip_addr"
                }
            }

            # print something in stdout
            output "publicip" {
                value = "${aws_instance.example.public_ip}"
            }
            ' |tee aws.tf

#. run **terraform**

    - execute following command to launch aws instance

        .. code-block:: bash

            terraform init
            terraform apply

Using Terraform to help Calm support Alicloud
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Overview
--------

- Using **Terraform** to focus on IAC (Infrastructure as a Code)
- Using **Calm** to focus on application deployment, and Day 2 operation
- Download blueprint from here: :download:`Alicloud ECS with TF <https://github.com/panlm/NTNX/raw/master/calm/blueprints/TF-Alicloud.json>`

Blueprint
---------

- **Service 1**: New VM

    - New a Service, **Cloud** is **Nutanix**

        .. figure:: images/terr1.png

    - you could just give 1 vcpu / 1 GB memory to this VM
    - execute `terraform` command from this VM, create ECS instance on Alicloud, and get the public ip of the new instance

- **Service 2**: Existed VM

    - New a Service, **Cloud** is **Existing Machine**
    - Get the IP address from previous services `@@{Terraform.alicloud_ecs_pub_ip}@@`

        .. figure:: images/terr2.png

Launch It
---------

- Launch successfully, you will see the public ip of Alicloud ECS
